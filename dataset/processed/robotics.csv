1678,smooth servo movement for crawling robot,made small crawler robot little while ago that had two legs with two degrees freedom each servos total while was the movement the legs noticed that they moved rather stiffly makes sense that the servo internal controller would have very quick response position commands but wanted crawler move way that seems little more smooth and life like solution was create cubic function time that describes the path the servos and then set their position small time increments resulting more smooth motion what did was solve for the cubic equation using the time interval starting and ending position the servo and starting and ending rates the servo should move which just the derivative the position solve for and position rate position given set the rate the servo between pair movements zero the movements were opposite directions and positive negative the movements were both the positive negative direction this worked pretty well but this solution limited few ways for one difficult decide what exactly the rates between movements that the same direction should used the average the slopes ahead and behind particular position between movements but isn clear that optimal second all cubic curves could take the servo position outside the range the positions the beginning and end movement which may for example some point during the time interval the curve could cause the servo beyond the second position below the first position thirdly curve generation here does not consider the maximum rate that the servo can turn curve may have the servo move speed that with that minor concern that the maximum turning rate depends the response servo internal controller and may change depending the size the position interval neglecting that last concern these issues may solved increasing the degree the polynomial and adding solve for the but now starting wonder there better way than this make servo movement smooth and seem more life like,servos kinematics

2000,positive definite property for covariance unscented kalman filter update,have unscented kalman filter ukf that tracks the state robot the state vector has variables each time carry out prediction step transfer function naturally acts the entire state however sensors provide different parts the robot state may get roll pitch yaw and their respective velocities one and then linear velocity another approach handling this far has been simply create sub matrices for the covariance carry out standard ukf update equations and then stick the resulting values back into the full covariance matrix however after few updates the ukf yells for trying pass matrix that isn positive definite into cholesky function clearly the covariance losing its positive definite properties and guessing has with attempts update subsets the full covariance matrix example taken from actual log file the following matrix after the ukf prediction step positive definite however after processing the correction for one variable this case linear velocity the matrix becomes the difference between the two matrices above you can see the only difference between the two the value the location the variance linear velocity which the just processed this difference enough break covariance matrix have two questions updating subset the filter doesn appear the right way about things there better solution missing step that would keep covariance matrix positive definite thanks edit looks like not properly placing the values back into the original covariance matrix simply copying the values back isn sufficient need track the for the covariance matrix and make sure that when update variance value update all the values its row column maintain the value have some more testing verify that this issue but some initial analysis matlab suggests that correct answer own question edit given the response below and after trying can see that original edit idea won fly however have one more question this ukf don actually have jacobian matrices think see how would make work within the ukf update equations but even ekf and ask because have one those well state function going end being the identity matrix directly measuring state variables the case take jacobian would just matrix with ones the location where the index the measured values the vector,kalman-filter
2009,ekf partial state update question,this follow positive definite property for covariance unscented kalman filter update but deserving its own question think processing ekf for subset the variables state state vector directly measuring state variables which means state function the identity trying update the first two variables state vector which are the and position robot kalman update matrices currently look like this state just test values left begin array ccc end array right covariance matrix pulled from log file left begin array ccc end array right just test values left begin array ccc end array right jacobean left begin array ccc end array right covariance just test values left begin array ccc end array right kalman gain left begin array ccc end array right meaning that innovation and therefore both and current state would need order have result add the current full state where vector containing only the parts the full state vector that measuring here question yields left begin array ccc end array right does make sense that this vector which will add the current state has non zero values positions other that and the and positions robot the other non zero locations correspond the robot location and the and velocities seems strange that and should yield changes other variables the state vector incorrect this assumption the covariance update works very well with the jacobean this form and maintains its positive definite property,kalman-filter

5251,feedback controller there any influence between outer and inner loop when running different,develop quadrotor only simulation using ros and the feedback controller resumes more less the following structure where you can think that process the dynamic movement the quadrotor motion equations the inner loop the attitude controller just sets the about all axis and the outer loop the position controller that takes care where the quadrotor actually why are they separated because many papers found out that the attitude controller pitch roll yaw need run higher frequency then any other controller the system the position controller instead needs run lower frequency the following picture better don scared more simpler than one could think now did the paper but discovered that quadrotor was really unstable and spent days and days trying correct the gains the controller without getting stable system intuition said that maybe they are running wrong frequency put different frequency values for the position controller being sure not multiply the main frequency something like and for example lately removed the timer program and let the position controller run the same frequency the attitude controller just because run out ideas and suddenly worked everything nice here question what should consider when system has outer inner how aware that regards and happy new year,control quadcopter

6659,graphslam why are imposed twice the matrix,was watching sebastian thrun video course for robotics freely available udacity com his final chapter graphslam how setup the system equations for the mean path locations and landmark locations setup the matrix system imposes each robot motion and landmark constraint twice for example robot motion command move from units the right reaching understand this constraint however also imposes the negative this equation constraint and onto different equation and not sure why his video course briefly mentions that the matrix assembling known the matrix but have why the matrix assembled this specific way tried read his book robotics and all can gather that these equations come from obtaining the minimizer the negative log posterior the motion commands and map which results quadratic function the unknown variables and since quadratic and the motion models are also linear the minimum obviously obtained solving linear system equations but why are each the imposed twice with once positive quantity and again the negative the same equation its not obvious from the form the negative log posterior the quadratic function that the must imposed twice why the matrix assembled this way does also hold true when the motion and models are nonlinear any help would greatly,slam
6661,freeimu external,have been using the freeimu library but now want add external that can mount away from motors figured out how modify the freeimu library use external and getting data what can figure out what need change now that has changed the free imu mounted like this the external compass mounted like this upside down rotated around changing the value inside the function all the other code calls this get the data far have tried changing the sign for the and values after have got them from the changing the sign for the value only changing the sign for the value only added both the and values from both the and values from and adding adding and from changing nothing the gui gives always gives strange results and doing the changes above just rotated mirrored the red and green graphs unable get rid the key hole shape the red the green the blue does the fact that works mean that issue with the value this how looks using the board what should try next thanks joe edit tried rotating the external the same the freeimu and still get the same result don think its the difference that causing the problem then thought maybe its because the freeimu mounted central the rotation axis and the external mounted about above tested this rotating only the external around itself and still got the same result this all seems strange you think its possible that the external have brought faulty any way confirm working properly its own thanks edit managed get circles plotting changing the gain from seem new was being saturated now just need work out how change values around the correct,quadcopter imu calibration magnetometer

6849,graph with,trying graph with mainly order perform loop closure however finding minimal working examples online issue found this project well this one the second one though has the form library one cannot really see how the author uses things contrast online loop closure where people update and optimize graph every time they detect loop doing graph only once after pairwise case pairwise and global graph based are two separate stages where the result the first the input for the second already have working solution but the way that works for quite different from the usual use nodes have identity matrices consider that are already with the poses the pairwise reg step and edges use the relative based the keypoints the also the keypoints are this case penalize deviations the relative pose from the identity matrix matrix inverse covariance simply use identity matrix multiplied the number found like this case the result the graph update matrix have multiply with this the camera poses although this works many most cases quite unusual approach while one cannot draw the graph for debugging all nodes are identities the beginning and the result after path which means that something goes wrong getting intuition about this not always easy trying follow the classic approach the vertices nodes are the poses the pairwise the edges are the relative based the keypoints features the raw the camera frame not the poses the pairwise the output are the new poses one simply replaces the old poses with the new ones drawing the graph this case makes sense for example case scanning object with turntable the camera poses form circle space trying form all the edges and then optimize only one stage this doesn mean only iteration though however cannot make things running nicely with the approach lot with the direction the edges and the relative that used the edges everything looks expected but still luck for simplicity still use the matrix mentioned above identity matrix multiplied with the number theory the matrix the inverse covariance but don really this for simplicity plus following this way compute the covariance not very easy are there any minimal working examples that not aware there something wrong what describe above are any rules thumb the first node both approaches above fixed that should follow and might not aware them update more specific questions the nodes hold the poses the robot camera unclear though which reference frame they are defined the world coordinate frame defined according the camera according the object first acquired pointcloud this would affect the the pose matrices during before the stage try form and optimize the graph only once the end for all the frames the edge src tgt hold the relative from just the based the features the two the local coordinate frame there and tricky point regarding the direction just with the relative enough the first node always fixed does the fixed node affect the direction the edge that departs ends from the fixed node there any other tricky point that could hinter working millimeter instead meter units not sure this will affect the solvers any way wouldn expect but naive use that was giving some usable results was influenced,slam

7462,how safety cages around quadcopter rotors blades affect lift,interested building quadcopter from scratch because like err the side caution adding safety cages around each propeller rotor hopefully prevent least minimize the chance the spinning rotor blades coming into contact with someone without knowing much about the physics behind how lift works would have imagine that cages present two main problems for rotors they add weight the copter making harder lift the same payload and they sheer presence surface area makes harder for the spinning rotor generate lift and push down away from the ground the former problem should obvious and self evident for the latter problem what mean surface area that imagine that the more caging around spinning rotor the more difficult will lift for instance spinning rotor might have the ability generate enough power lift say but were construct entire box not cage around the entire rotors with sides and openings would imagine its lift capability would drop obviously what interested cage design that provides adequate safety but doesn box the rotor much that causes the rotor incapable providing lift looking for that optimal tradeoff safety boxing caging around the spinning rotor and lift would imagine and designing this pretty huge with lot math behind just wondering anyone has already figured all this stuff out anyone knows way model this safety lift trade off some way,quadcopter

7832,kalman filter for estimating position with direction,currently working pose estimation problem for which would like use filtering explain the system briefly consists two cameras and each has its own gps imu module the main assumption that camera fixed and stable whereas camera has noisy pose using computer vision obtain the pose metric and rotation camera camera that can improve upon the inherent noise gps imu modules the problem here that the obtained through the vision method only arbitrary scale any given instant can only obtain unit vector that specifies the direction the and not absolute metric the camera based estimation although accurate has idea about how much actual distance between the cameras which why have the gps which gives position data with some noise example camera the east camera the pose from vision algorithm would say north east camera would something like hence would possible consider the gps estimate the metric well its covariance ellipse and somehow link with the normalized camera obtain final more accurate estimate metric not sure what kind filters would happy use that has absolute value thanks,kalman-filter cameras pose

10312,difference between camera using projection and stereo camera,currently busy with final year project which requires track people walking through doorway initially thought this may possible using normal camera and using some motion detection functions given opencv have however come the conclusion that the the camera mounted too low for this work height shown the image below have now been looking into using camera stereo camera try and get around this problem have seen similar examples where kinect from xbox has been used generate depth map which then processed and used the tracking this was however done from higher vantage point and found that the minimum operating range the kinect from what have found the kinect uses projector and receiver generate its depth map and have been looking the orbbec astra which uses similar system and has minimum working distance question now what exactly would the difference between the depth maps produced camera that uses projector and receiver and stereo camera such the duo zed type options just looking for some insight from people that may have used these types cameras before side note going about this the right way should looking into time flight cameras instead edit goal count the people moving into and out the train doorway began this using opencv initially with background and blob detection method this only worked for one person time and with test video filmed higher vantage point blob merging problem was shown the left image below the next method tested involved optical flow method using motion vectors obtained from opencv dense optical flow algorithm from which was able obtain motion vectors from the higher test videos and track them shown the middle image below because the densely packed and easily detected motion vectors was simple cluster them but when this same system was attempted with footage taken from inside train lower height was unable give consistant output thoughts the reasons for this was because the low height the camera single camera tracking able function when there sufficient space between the camera and the top the person but the distance minimized the area the frame that the moving person takes becomes larger and larger and the space which the person can compared reduced atleast that how understand below the right you can see how the image the color the persons clothing almost uniform optical flow therefore unable detect motion both cases only started working with computer vision few months ago please forgive have missed some crucial aspects from what have seen from research most commercial systems make used cameras stereo cameras time flight cameras but unsure how the specifics each these would best suited for,computer-vision cameras stereo-vision
