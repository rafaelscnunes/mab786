That means, if we denote an encryption of a plain text $X$ as ${X}_i$, then we would have that ${ { X }_i }_j = { X }_{i \\circ j}$.</p>\n",

      "I've been reading a paper [1], and I've ran across something called a \"Group Cipher\", which is similar to homomorphic encryption, with an important difference.\n",
      "In homomorphic encryption we have an encryption operation $E_k: P \\rightarrow C$, where $P$ is the set of plain texts and $C$ is the set of cipher texts. We also have an efficient group operation on $C$ that induces a homomorphism to the group operation on $P$.\n",
      "The difference with Group Ciphers is that the group operation on $C$ is composition of encryption $E$, and it induces a homomorphism on the group operation of the set of keys $K$. That means, if we denote an encryption of a plain text $X$ as ${X}_i$, then we would have that ${ { X }_i }_j = { X }_{i \\circ j}$.\n",
      "In the paper they use it to do something like asymmetric encryption, but using symmetric encryption. They do need a semi-trusted third party.\n",
      "For example, Alice's key is $i$, Bob's key is $j$. Ted has the key $i^{-1} \\circ j$.\n",
      "Alice will encryption something : ${X}_i$. Send it to Ted, who will then encrypt it again : ${ {X}_i }_{i^{-1} \\circ j}$ , which will yield ${X}_j$, then Ted send it to Alice again. After that Alice sends it to Bob. Bob can then decrypt it.\n",
      "What happened here is that Alice can send to Bob, without knowing bob's (symmetric) key. And Bob can decrypt without knowing Alice's (symmetric) key. Just like asymmetric encryption. But using symmetric encryption instead (and a semi-trusted third party).\n",
      "They also prove that the Pohlig-Hellman cipher has this property.\n",
      "The question is:\n",
      "\n",
      "1- Does Group Ciphers have any other applications in the literature (with references) ?\n",
      "2- What are the drawbacks of this scheme compared to asymmetric encryption (other than the required semi-trusted third party) ? \n",
